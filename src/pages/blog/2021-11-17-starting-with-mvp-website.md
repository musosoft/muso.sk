![muso.sk Blog OG meta image](/img/og-image.png)

It's been two years since I did anything about my portfolio page. The information was outdated and very simplified.
While this change is going to be bigger in future, for now at least a little functionality goes public. Iâ€™ll explain how the blog came to be, how technical enthusiasists can use it along with clients and what it all actually mean.

## What the updates mean to you

muso.sk was founded in 2016, as a freelance organization to deliver services for the IT industry. Currently with one member with identical nickname 'muso.sk' covering more than 3 countries (Slovakia, Czechia, Thailand...), representing numerous segments of the IT industry, including:

<!-- For over 10 years muso.sk has been dedicated to creating a satisfying experience for the community by recognizing, developing and promoting specialty coffee. SCAA sets and maintains quality standards for the industry, conducts market research, and provides education, training, resources, and business services for its members.

Coffee cupping, or coffee tasting, is the practice of observing the tastes and aromas of brewed coffee. It is a professional practice but can be done informally by anyone or by professionals known as "Q Graders". A standard coffee cupping procedure involves deeply sniffing the coffee, then loudly slurping the coffee so it spreads to the back of the tongue.

The coffee taster attempts to measure aspects of the coffee's taste, specifically the body (the texture or mouthfeel, such as oiliness), sweetness, acidity (a sharp and tangy feeling, like when biting into an orange), flavour (the characters in the cup), and aftertaste. Since coffee beans embody telltale flavours from the region where they were grown, cuppers may attempt to identify the coffee's origin. -->

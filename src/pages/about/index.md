### Hi I'm muso.sk, nice to meet you!

Since beginning my journey as a Freelance years ago, I've done remote work for agencies, consulted for startups, and collaborated with both business and consumer use.
⁣⁣
I'm twenty eight. A developer, IT guy and traveller. I'm originally from Slovakia. I moved to Thailand, to live in the jungle in the paradise island to deliver a code full of sunshine vibes. ✈️⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣
I'm currently looking for new digital opportunities. I am happy to contribute to a project that you need help with in. In addition to development I can also assist with IT related technology, SEO and UX.

My main goal is to connect with new people, exchange my skills to help them with everything I can. ☀️
I'm used to work remotely, value having decent ethics, and an open mind. Different perspectives are important to me. ☀️
⁣⁣
I am a Front-end website developer with a bit of backend experience. My skills include HTML, CSS, SCSS, WordPress, Cross Browser Compatibility, Responsive Design, Git, ReactJS, Adobe Photoshop, Tailwind, Bootstrap, Bash and more 💪⁣⁣⁣
As Consultant I depend on community, service support and stackowerflow, trying to minimize workload, prices and stress.

Other than that I'm an open-minded IT guy passionate about Software/Hardware, Android smartphones, eSport servers, Linux servers, Crypto... I would continue but I hate to tinkle 😎

Those above are also my hobbies since I was young, some of my other activities include 🏔 Mountaineering 🌏 Traveling 🔊 Nightclubs and Clubbing ⚾ Baseball 🌐 Learning Thai 💻 Coding 🌊 Swimming 🖥️ Building Computers🚲Cycling 😆️ Memes 📽 Watching Movies 🎮 Video Games 🎧Listening electronic music...⁣⁣⁣⁣

Do you currently need any help with a project? 🤔
